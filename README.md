# MoodBeats
MoodBeats 🥁 is an intelligent music system that analyzes facial expressions to detect the listener’s emotions and automatically plays songs that match their current mood. By combining facial recognition technology with emotion classification, the system bridges the gap between human feelings and music preferences.


MoodBeats is a cutting-edge music recommendation platform that connects moods to music intelligently. Multi modal facial recognition and emotion detection technology is used to gauge a listener’s facial cues in real time to determine their mood (happy, sad, relaxed, energetic and so on). When it recognizes the mood, it will automatically select and play songs that match the listener’s current state, creating an intentional and emotion-based music listening experience.


With the addition of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and music psychology, MoodBeats will change how people interact with music. It will replace the process of selecting a song manually, providing a playlist that reflects one's emotional response to the expression immediately. The product’s fusion of technology and emotion not only promotes more engagement, but also model what it means for AI to humanize the experience through empathy-based design.
